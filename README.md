Mplayer Manager
===============

A commandline interface for mplayer. It manages a database of movies and playlists, 
helping you to keep track of what is still in your queue and what you have watched already. 
It keeps track of where you left off viewing each file and quick-resumes viewing again at that location.

This app is basically a helper tool for obsessive people who like to be watching a large number
of movie files at any one time. It speeds up the process of finding, loading and resuming the files,
as well as easing the process of keeping track of them all. It does all of that for you. 
As well of keeping a tally on what you have watched, for the extremely perversely curious.

All you have to do to use it is add a new movie by running ```watch -a <movie>```, and then enter 
interactive mode with ```watch```, and select the movie to watch it.

Note: you must have updated version of mplayer and node.js installed.
