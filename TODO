X
X config.json    - local database for config
X movies.json    - database for just movies
X 
X search path for config: [$HOME,"$HOME/.mplayermanager/",'.']
X
X startup dialog that runs first time, prompting user for:
X - location to store 'movies.json'
X - location to store 'config.json'
X 
X way in commandline to change config options
X rewrite 2nd set of cmdline functions to not be dependent on argv[] specific locations: eg. argv[2], but use check_arg() instead
  so example usage this would allow: "watch -c ./custom_config.js -a new_movie new_movie_dir".  Can't do this now.
    (note: you can make additional script: 'watchp' --> node ~/code/watch.js -c ./custom_conf.js')
X { sec_watched: } key in movie row. calculate total cumulative seconds watched for each file
X   account for skips using arrow keys, to get more accurate... Ohhhhh, just get current Unix()sec at beginning and Unix()sec at end.
X cmdline option to 
    - IMMEDIATELY ADD A FILE, 
    - DETERMINE ITS LOCATION AUTOMATICALLY, and if its not in the path list, 
    - AUTOMATICALLY CREATE A "DIR" ENTRY
X option to print out list of things watched, ordered by sec_watched
X save the num_last_watched: most recent watched
X rewrite the db format to include PERMANENT_INDEX, to simplify ordering them  (its buggy now)
  X two sets of movid: 1-N watched:true, 1-N watched:false
  X write pid by hand into movies.db
  X display code
  X load code
  X order code
  X change index code
  X call renormalize() in '-ci' function
  X put '[pid]' in -watched flag
X movies can have optional DISPLAY_NAME that appears instead of their filename. If you edit the "name" of a file, it creates a display_name and shows that instead


* move 'vid' script into watch.js


* This module is intended to be installed globally with 'npm install -g'

* have a /usr/bin/watch script which calls 'node /location_of_watch.js'
* interactive installation of run-script in /usr/bin/
  - asks for root pass to install

* even MORE intelligent path searching, using 'find /dir -name <file>'
  algorithm: go through path list. 
  * Or just get array of sub-dirs in each search-path, and look for the file in those.

N ability to edit array of paths in setup

* playlist: way to {create, edit, delete, execute} multiple playlists

* abstract interface from control functions. This allows to create 2 iface modules:
  1) commandline
  2) browser


* rememember options per movie

* way to play watched movies

    - TAB-completion <-- tab &/or getch() doesn't work in any input mode
        TAB-completion control wishlist:
        1 - press [w] Watch...; a prompt comes up. "watch what?> "
        2 - press 'J', 
        2b -then press TAB; available movies that start with J will appear in alphabetical order
        3 - press ESC to clear the line
        4 - press REturn to accept a choice
        5 - press more letters to narrow it down some
        6 - press up and down arrows to move selector, and ENTER to select

* explicit video size modifier menu option

* playlists

- exactly the same as previous; then play the movie, all in one

- put on a lock when running, so if external shell adds file, it prints an error
